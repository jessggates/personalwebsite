            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>I am a Sr. Product Owner with Rocket Mortgage Technology. I have worked
                at Rocket for almost 9 years in various positions, but technology has become
                my home. I'm excited to learn more about software 
                development to challenge myself and see where it takes me!
            </p>
            <h3>Life</h3>
            <p>On October 6, 2023, I married my best friend! We had an amazing wedding weekend 
                in Traverse City, MI, surrounded by all our favorite friends and family.
