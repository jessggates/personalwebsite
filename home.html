            <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website!</h2>
            <p>My name is Jess Gates. I am 30 years old, and love life. My hobbies are shopping, traveling, 
                spending time with friends and family, playing video games, and watching medical dramas on the 
                couch with my cats. I consider myself a foodie (mostly I just like to eat) and I never turn down
                 an aeperol spritz or espresso martini. </p>

            <h2>Developing</h2>
            <p>I have spent the past 3 years at Rocket Mortgage on the technology team working with some 
                amazing software engineers to develop our mortgage banking platform. 
                I am super passionate about solving problems with tech. To be able to jump in and knock out 
                work myself, I signed up for the Grand Circus C# .NET Full Stack bootcamp to gain some experience.
                Never hurts to build up the resume!
            </p>
            <p>So far I have learned:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>C# .NET</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Hometown</h2>
            <p>I was born in Macomb, MI, but currently reside in North Corktown, Detroit, MI. I went to Wayne State
                University in Detroit, and decided to work and live here too, being the loyal person that I am!
                My dream is to live in Maine, but my boss needs to approve my ability to be remote.
